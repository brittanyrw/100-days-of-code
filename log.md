# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: January 2, 2016 

**Today's Progress**: Prep day! Setting up everything so that the rest of the challenge will be easier for me to manage. I also have decided that I am going to use this challenge to get me started coding every day this year. 

**Thoughts:** I'm really excited to get started on the challenge. I think that Tweeting and writing blog posts will really help keep me on track.
