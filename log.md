### Day 2: January 4, 2017

**Thoughts:** 

Made some good progress on the CSS for my project but of course, it still needs a lot of work. Working on the mobile phone version right now. The color scheme I originally chose is actually working out.

### Day 1: January 3, 2017 

**Today's Progress**: 

1. Started on my coding calendar webpage. I drew some wireframes to get an idea of the type of layout I'd like to create. I then created the html structure and will see if it works out tomorrow when I add CSS. (1.5 hrs)

2. I attended an Intro to Javascript course hosted by Thinkful DC. Very helpful and it was nice to be around other people instead of just learning on my own. (2 hrs)

3. Continued with You Don't Know JS: Up & Going Chapter 1. (1 hr)

Total hours learning: 4.5 hrs

**Thoughts:** 

Drawing out my idea for the calendar really made laying out the HTML easier for me. Also, doing it by hand was much faster than trying to put something together in Photoshop.

### Day 0: January 2, 2017 

**Today's Progress**: 

Prep day! Setting up everything so that the rest of the challenge will be easier for me to manage. I also have decided that I am going to use this challenge to get me started coding every day this year. 

Today I drafted an introduction blog post for this challenge and my 2017 coding journey. 

**Thoughts:** 

I'm really excited to get started on the challenge. I think that Tweeting and writing blog posts will really help keep me on track.
